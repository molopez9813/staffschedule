# Nurse Scheduler - Hospital Staff Scheduling App

A modern web application for hospital staff (nurses, PCTs, and unit clerks) to manage and track their work schedules. This app will work on iPhone, Android, and web browsers.

## üìö What is This?

This is a **React** application built with **Vite** - a modern development tool that helps you build web applications quickly. 

### Key Technologies:
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that makes development smooth and efficient
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used throughout

## üé® What's Included

### Landing Page Features:
- **Login Form**: For existing users to sign in
- **Sign Up Form**: For new users to create an account
- Beautiful gradient background with modern design
- Responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Tab switching between login and signup forms

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

### Step 1: Install Node.js
If you don't have Node.js installed:
1. Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download and install the LTS (Long Term Support) version
3. This installs both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Open your terminal (Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows) and run:

```bash
npm install
```

**What this does**: Downloads all the necessary libraries and packages your app needs to run (like React, Vite, etc.)

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

Run this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**What this does**: Starts a local development server on your computer

You should see output like:
```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 4: View in Your Browser

Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) and go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

**Congratulations!** You should now see the Nurse Scheduler landing page with the login/signup form.

## üìù What Each File Does

### Project Structure:
```
nursescheduler/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json          # Lists all dependencies and scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vite.config.js        # Vite configuration settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html            # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.jsx         # Entry point - starts the React app
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.jsx          # Main component with login/signup forms
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css          # Styles for the app
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css        # Global styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # This file
```

**Explanations:**
- `package.json`: Like a recipe card - it lists all ingredients (packages) your app needs
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration file that tells Vite how to build your app
- `index.html`: The base HTML structure
- `src/main.jsx`: This is where your React app starts
- `src/App.jsx`: Contains your landing page with login/signup functionality
- `src/App.css`: All the styling to make it look beautiful
- `src/index.css`: Global styles that apply to everything

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server (use this to view and test)
- `npm run build` - Create production-ready files (for when you're ready to deploy)
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build

## üì± How It Works

1. **Login/Signup Toggle**: Click the tabs at the top to switch between "Log In" and "Sign Up"
2. **Form Validation**: The app checks that you've filled in all required fields
3. **Password Confirmation**: When signing up, you must enter the same password twice
4. **Responsive Design**: The page automatically adjusts to different screen sizes

## üí° Tips for Development

1. **Auto-Reload**: While the dev server is running, any changes you make will automatically update in the browser
2. **Developer Tools**: Right-click in your browser and select "Inspect" to see the code and debug
3. **Console**: Open browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) to see any messages or errors
4. **Local Storage**: The app stores data in your browser's localStorage - you can view it in Developer Tools > Application > Local Storage

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
- If port 5173 is busy, Vite will automatically use the next available port (5174, 5175, etc.)
- Check the terminal output for the correct URL

**Module not found errors?**
- Run `npm install` again to ensure all dependencies are installed

**Changes not showing?**
- Refresh your browser
- Check the terminal for any error messages

## üìß Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about how to run or modify the application, check the terminal output for error messages.
